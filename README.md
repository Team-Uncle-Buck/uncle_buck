## About
This is a Financial Independence Calculator Full-Stack Web App created for the PSU Open Source class in the Summer 2020 by team "Uncle Buck". The calculator is a toy meant for entertainment purposes by allowing the user play around with some number to see if and when they can reach financial independence.

*Financial Independence* is the status of having enough income (from investments, passive businesses, real estate, etc.) to pay for one's reasonable living expenses for the rest of one's life without having to rely on formal employment. The core path to achieve financial independence focuses on maximizing one's savings rate through lower spending and/or higher income. Checkout some of the resources listed [here](Resources.md) for a lot information about the theory and some ideas on how to achieve financial independence.
