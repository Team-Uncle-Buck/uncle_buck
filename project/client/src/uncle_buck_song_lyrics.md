### Uncle Buck Theme Song Lyrics

Well he’s the baddest cat in town
And the coolest uncle in town
He won’t say see ya later
Unless you use his calculator

Yeah ya know 
Who I’m talking’ about
Yeah he’s the one
You go to when you’re in doubt
Help you with your finance
He’ll make you dance

Uncle Buck (yeah he’ll save you a buck or two)
Uncle Buck (ooo he’ll help you think it through)
Uncle Buck (yeah he’s the only one)
Uncle Buck (who makes budgeting fun)
