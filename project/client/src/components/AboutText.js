        <h4>Financial Independence</h4>
        <p>
        Financial Independence is the status of having enough income (from 
        investments, passive businesses, real estate, etc.) to pay for one's
        reasonable living expenses for the rest of one's life without having to
        rely on formal employment. The core path to achieve financial 
        independence focuses on maximizing one's savings rate through lower 
        spending and/or higher income.

        <h4>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
        <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has 
        been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
        only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
